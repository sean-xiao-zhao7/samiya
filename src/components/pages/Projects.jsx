                    Praise God for the childrenâ€™s programs we are running in the
                    slums in Uganda. We thank God for bringing on board two new
                    soccer coaches who are willing to come and volunteer to
                    teach our street children how to play soccer and share the
                    gospel with our young people{" "}
